# Prerequisites

## Vitis/Vivado setting up

For the contest, the CVA6 processor will be implemented on Zybo Z7-20 board from Digilent. This board integrates a Zynq 7000 FPGA from Xilinx.
To do so, **Vitis 2020.1** environment from Xilinx needs to be installed.

Furthermore, Digilent provides board files for each development board.

These files ease the creation of new projects with automated configuration of several complicated components such as Zynq Processing System and memory interfaces.

All guidelines to install **vitis 2020.1** and **Zybo Z7-20** board files are explained in
https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/guides/installation.

**Be careful about your linux distribution and the supported version of Vitis 2020.1 environment.**

## Hardware

# FPGA platform

A FPGA platform running **CV32A6** (CVA6 in 32b flavor) has been implemented on **Zybo Z7-20**

This platform includes a CV32A6 processor, a JTAG interface to run and debug software applications and a UART interface to display strings on hyperterminal.

The steps to run the RIPE application on CV32A6 FPGA platform are described below.

The JTAG-HS2 programming cable is initially a cable that allows programming of Xilinx FPGAs (bitstream loading) from a host PC.

In our case, we use this cable to program software applications on the CV32A6 instantiated in the FPGA through a PMOD connector.

## Get the Zybo ready

1. First, make sure the Digilent **JTAG-HS2 debug adapter** is properly connected to the **PMOD JE** connector and that the USBAUART adapter is properly connected to the **PMOD JB** connector of the Zybo Z7-20 board.
![alt text](./docs/pictures/20201204_150708.jpg)

2. Generate the bitstream of the FPGA platform:
```
$ make cva6_fpga
```

3. When the bitstream is generated, switch on Zybo board and run:
```
$ make program_cva6_fpga
```
When the bitstream is loaded, the green LED `done` lights up.
![alt text](./docs/pictures/20201204_160542.jpg)

4. Get a hyperterminal configured on /dev/ttyUSB0 11520-8-N-1

Now, the hardware is ready and the hyperterminal is connected to the UART output of the FPGA. We can now start the software.

## Get started with Zephyr in the docker image

### Installation

#### Building Developer Docker Image

The developer docker image can be built using the following command from the zephyr-docker folder:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) -t zephyr-build:v1 .
```

It can be used for building Zephyr samples and tests by mounting the Zephyr workspace into it:

```
docker run -ti --privileged -v `realpath workspace`:/workdir zephyr-build:v1
```

All the following commands should be run from the docker.

### Usage

#### Initialization of Zephyr

To initialize Zephyr environment with the Thales modified Zephyr:

```
cd /workdir
west init -m https://forgens.univ-ubs.fr/gitlab/breizh-hat/riscv-zephyr --mr main
west update
```

Thales modifications add CV32A6 support on Zybo board.

#### Building a sample application

Follow the steps below to build and run a sample application:

```
west build -p -b qemu_riscv32 /workdir/zephyr/samples/hello_world
west build -t run
```

You should now have a running hello world project on qemu_riscv32.

#### Building RIPE for the CV32A6 on ZYBO

The test is selected in the /workdir/ripe/src/ripe_attack_generator.c file with the following macro :
```
#define ATTACK_NR 1
```
By default its value is 1 but you should try to protect against as many scenario as possible.

Now that we have a working environment, we can build the RIPE attack.

```
west build -p -b cv32a6_zybo /workdir/ripe
```

#### Running the RIPE application on the CV32A6

You can launch the elf file located in build/zephyr/zephyr.elf with the tools provided by zephyr-sdk.
```
west debug
```

You should see
```

```

You can then run the RIPE application with command `c`:
```
(gdb) c
Continuing.
```

On the host hyperterminal you should see:
