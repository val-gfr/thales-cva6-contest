# thales-cva6-contest
Our work as students (Team Breizh Hat) for the national CVA6 softcore hackathon organized by Thales Group
- logs files for the benchmark
- report in pdf format
- a link to our video (coming soon)

To sum up what we did, here what is done:
- a state of art : CVA6, RISC-V memory features, vulnerabilities (stack, heap)
- set our experimental environnment with the Zedboard Zynq-Z7 FPGA
- load the bitstream generated to the FPGA & test RIPE program on it
- mesure the impact on the compiler flags, the Zephyr canaries too
- thinking about countermeasures: the CVA6 PMP and a Shadow Stack

We haven't finished all of what we would like but it was interesting to participate to the contest!
